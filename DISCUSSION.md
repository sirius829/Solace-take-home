# Discussion on Changes Made

## Overview

In this assignment, I focused on improving the structure and functionality of the Next.js application that displays a list of advocates. The primary changes made include the implementation of a search feature, refactoring of the code for better readability and maintainability, and the integration of Material-UI for a more polished user interface.

## Key Changes

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Moved the fetching logic for advocates to a dedicated context or service (if applicable) to keep the component clean and focused on rendering.
   - Created a controlled input for the search feature, allowing for better state management and user experience.

2. **Search Functionality**:
   - Implemented a search feature that filters advocates based on multiple fields (first name, last name, city, degree, specialties, and years of experience).
   - The search is case-insensitive, improving usability for users.

3. **Use of Material-UI**:
   - Integrated Material-UI components for the table and pagination, enhancing the overall look and feel of the application.
   - Utilized MUI's `Table`, `TableHead`, `TableBody`, and `TablePagination` components to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.

4. **TypeScript Enhancements**:
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for better type safety and clarity in the codebase.
   - Ensured that all event handlers and state variables are properly typed.

5. **Debouncing the Search Input**:
   - Implementing a debounce mechanism for the search input could improve performance, especially with larger datasets. This would limit the number of filter operations triggered as the user types.

6. **Pagination Enhancements**:
   - Consider adding server-side pagination if the dataset grows significantly. This would reduce the amount of data sent to the client and improve load times.

## Future Improvements

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error handling for the fetch operation to manage scenarios where the API call fails. This could include displaying a user-friendly message or a fallback UI.

2. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for the search functionality and the AdvocateList component to ensure reliability and maintainability of the code.

3. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Review the application for accessibility best practices, ensuring that all users can effectively interact with the UI.

## Conclusion

Overall, the changes made to the application enhance its functionality and user experience. The implementation of the search feature and the use of Material-UI significantly improve the usability of the advocate listing. I look forward to further refining the application based on the suggestions outlined above.
